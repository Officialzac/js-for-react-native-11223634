Assignment descriptin:This assignment demonstrates my understanding of JavaScript concepts, including array manipulation and object creation. The project consists of two main parts:

AN EXPLANATION OF THE CODE
- processArray uses the map method to create a new array with the transformed numbers. It checks if each number is even (using the modulo operator %) and squares it if so, or triples it if not.
- formatArrayStrings also uses the map method to create a new array with the modified strings. It checks the corresponding processed number (using the index) and capitalizes the string if the number is even, or converts it to lowercase if the number is odd.
-createuserprofiles - The id variable is initialized to 1 and will be incremented for each user profile.
- The createUserProfiles function uses the map method to create an array of user profile objects.
- Each object has three properties:
    - originalName: the original name from the names array.
    - modifiedName: the corresponding modified name from the modifiedNames array.
    - id: a unique identifier incremented for each profile.
